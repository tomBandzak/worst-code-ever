# Worst code ever
You can show your refactoring skills on this app. Feel free to:
* Change code
* Add other libraries
* Remove unnecessary libraries
* Fix bugs if you discover any

But don't forget to fulfill desired behavior. 

## Desired behavior
* After app is loaded, it shows first page of contacts (10) generated by `https://randomuser.me/api/` with seed `worst-code-ever`
* Contact list uses pagination
* User is able to search loaded contacts by their first and last name
* User can "like" some Contact, after that it is shown on Favourites page and indicated on contact list. Assume `email` is unique identification of contact. 
There is no need for persisting Favourites after reloading page. 
* There is "Drawer"-like menu with two items (All and Favourites) - there is no need to use routing, but feel free to use it if you like. 


## Other notes
* Your work doesn't have to be graphical heaven, but you can show your sense for design and CSS if you want

## Running
* First you need to `yarn install`
* Then run the app `yarn start`
